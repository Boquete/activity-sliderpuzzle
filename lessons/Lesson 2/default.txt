Slider Puzzle Lesson 2: Puzzle-Solving Contest (Team work activity)

	Working in teams of 2-3 people, try to solve a 9-tile Slider Puzzle in the fastest time. Each team must select the same image, and click on it at the same time (Count: “3, 2, 1, GO!”).  The timer indicates who finishes first.  

	The winning team should share their strategies with the class. Each team member should say one thing about how they solved the puzzle quickly and worked together. 

	Other students should describe their strategies too. Encourage everyone to name one way their puzzle solving skills have improved since the first time they played.

	Repeat the contest with a 12 and 16 tile puzzle. Allow the winner of the preceding round to choose the puzzle image. Does the strategy change when there are more puzzle tiles to move? How?
