Slider Puzzle Lesson 3: “My Picture” (Conveying original ideas)
	From the Home screen of your XO, click on the “Paint” program.  

	Explore how the Paint activity works. Play and experiment with all the fun features (brushes, bucket, spray, different colors, etc.)  

	Create a picture that you would like to turn into a Slider puzzle. Save it as “sliderpuzzle1” and close Paint.

	Open the Slider Puzzle and click on the “My Picture” button to find your “sliderpuzzle1” image.  A window will open that shows the contents in your Journal -- look for “sliderpuzzle1” and click on it. Then click the “OK” button. The Journal window will close and your image will appear in the Slider Puzzle. 

	Play with your puzzle. Could you solve it? What made it hard or easy to solve? Switch laptops with a friend and try to solve one of their original puzzle images.

	Share your experiences as a group: What makes an image easy or difficult to solve as a puzzle? Which strategies were helpful?  One student should record this conversation on their XO Laptop using the “Write” program.

	Now try creating a puzzle picture using the Record activity. Take a photo and save it as “sliderpuzzle2” and close Record. Go back to Slider Puzzle and open the new image from “My Picture” as before, then play with it.
