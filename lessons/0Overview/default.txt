Slider Puzzle: Lesson Plans Overview

A slider puzzle is a classic logic game that challenges a player to slide tiles on a board to form a picture or pattern. You may not lift any tile off the board; you can only slide a tile up, down, right or left. You must use strategy and logic to find a sequence of moves that will allow you to unscramble the tiles and solve the puzzle. 

This digital Slider Puzzle provides a fun context for young learners (and beginning XO users) to explore basic functions of the XO Laptop, learn individual and collaborative problem-solving skills, and develop creative projects that reflect an understanding of curriculum they are studying. 

Throughout the school year, the Slider Puzzle activity can be integrated into different subject areas (i.e. geography, math, creative writing).  Students can make puzzle images relating to a subject the class is studying, and share them with peers. In the process they will also learn how to use and integrate the output from activiites like Paint and Record, and how to collaborate over the Mesh.
